The mtools syslinux installer for Mac can be compiled using a full Xcode
installation or the command line development tools installed by xcode-select.
If using Xcode configure the project file path, argument and variable settings
to match your development environment for building, running and debugging.

Makefile options include:

make         - build program binaries
make clean   - delete all build files and binaries
make dist    - delete build files and move binaries to bios folder
make install - copy binaries, man pages and mbr sector files to
               the installation folders defined in mk/mac.mk

This installer requires the mtools package downloaded through either the
MacPorts or HomeBrew package managers and unprivileged device write access
which can obtained temporarily by using chmod to give write permission to
the "Operator" group (membership required) on the targeted block device.
